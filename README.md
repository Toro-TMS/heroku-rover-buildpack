# Heroku Rover Buildpack

A buildpack for installing the Apollo's [Rover CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/). Rover can be used to interact with Apollo Studio. One common use case is to register the GraphQL schema of an app once deployed.

This buildpack will always install the lastest version of Rover.
